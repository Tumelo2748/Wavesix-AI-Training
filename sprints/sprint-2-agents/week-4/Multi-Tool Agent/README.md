You can also ask questions in natural language about the contract.

üìù You: list

üìÑ Available Contracts:
  1. sample_service_agreement.txt

Type 'open <contract_name>' to analyze a contract.

üìù You: open 1

üìÑ Reading contract: sample_service_agreement.txt

üõ† Tool call: extract_clauses()
üõ† Tool call: classify_clause()
üõ† Tool call: summarize_document()

‚úÖ Final Answer:
I've analyzed the Sample Service Agreement. Here's a summary:

This is a service agreement between Don't Play Corporation and a Client, outlining the terms for services described in Schedule A. Key points include:

1. Services will be performed according to professional standards
2. The agreement can be terminated with 30 days' notice by the Client
3. Either party can terminate immediately for material breach
4. Payment terms include monthly invoicing with 30-day payment period
5. Contains confidentiality and data privacy provisions
6. Includes intellectual property rights allocation
7. Has liability limitations and disclaimers of warranties
8. Uses California law for governance and arbitration for disputes

High-risk clauses include the termination provisions, liability limitations, and data collection clauses. Would you like me to explain any specific section in more detail?

üìù You: explain the data privacy section

ü§ñ Assistant:
The data privacy section (Section 5) outlines how the company handles client data. Here's a simplified explanation:

5.1 Data Collection: The company collects data from the client and its users, including personal information, device identifiers, and usage patterns. This allows them to provide the contracted services.

5.2 Data Use: The company can use this collected data for three primary purposes:
   - Improving their services
   - Providing customer support
   - Analyzing usage patterns

Importantly, the company states they will not sell or rent the client's data to third parties without explicit consent from the client. This is a positive privacy protection.

5.3 Data Security: The company commits to implementing "reasonable" technical and organizational measures to protect the client's data from unauthorized access, disclosure, or destruction.

Key considerations about this section:
- The term "reasonable" for security measures is somewhat vague and provides flexibility for the company
- While the company won't sell data without consent, they can still use it internally for various purposes
- There's no specific mention of data retention periods or deletion policies
- The clause doesn't specify what happens to data if the agreement terminates

This is a moderate-risk section because while it provides some protections, it still gives the company significant latitude in how they handle your data.
